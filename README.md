# "Basic Files" - to include in most projects

version 0.1.0 or [version badge](https://badge.fury.io/)

A repository that helps my new projects cover some basics that most poeple don't focus, unless they have to.

## Getting Started

The repository is a great place to copy and paste what is helpful and learn more about project files you might want to include in every project.

### What the app should do?

These files are a place to start. Not every project needs these files. I find myself wanting to have some part of each of these files once I have finished my first build of THE APP. The one APP I created that will rule the world and raise me up out of poverty!

### Why is this app useful?

You should think about these files because... 

**1** Without a license file someone will steal your intellectual property or not use your app because they don't legally know where they stand.

**2** A good ReadMe file speaks to your user and can help devs go from 0 to 60 with your project. This helps folks get on board with your idea faster.

**3** Remember all those folks that help you make the app the behemoth it is today.

**4** Set a level playing field for anyone that wants to join the team. Plus this is one of the best ways to inclusive of others.

**5** Security flaws will happen. Create a doorbell for the good samaritan to help out.
